// Install create-react-app to create a react application
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
https://reactjs.org/

npm install create-react-app -g
cd <directory>
create-react-app <app name>

NOTE: 
  For some reason command above won't work for me. After I install
  create-react-app globally and run create-react-app, I get error 
  saying create-react-app command could not be found


// Instead I reason

npx create-react-app <app name>
