justify content (container's horizontal alignment):
  - center
  - flex-start
  - flex-end
  - space-around
  - space-between


align-items (container's vertical alignment):
  - center
  - flex-start
  - flex-end
  - stretch
  - baseline

flex-wrap: forces items that don’t fit to get bumped down to the next row

flex-direction: 
(refers to whether a container renders its items 
horizontally or vertically in normal or reverse order)
  - row
  - row-reverse
  - column
  - column-reverse

NOTE: When set flex-direction to column, justify-content refers to the container's vertical 
      alignment while align-items refers to the container's horizontal alignment.


Auto-margins in flexbox are special. They can be used as an alternative to 
an extra <div> when trying to align a group of items to the left/right of 
a container. Think of auto-margins as a “divider” for flex items in the same container.
